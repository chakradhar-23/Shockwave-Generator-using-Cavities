# Impact of Cavity Geometry on Shockwave Generation

This study investigates the impact of cavity geometry on shockwave generation and propagation in a supersonic flow. Shockwaves are compression waves that carry immense pressure, temperature, and momentum gradients, typically forming when a source imparts energy to a medium at a speed faster than the speed of sound. Various cavity shapes, including semicircular, elliptical, rectangular, triangular, and combinations thereof, are examined to understand their influence on peak pressure and amplification factors. Computational simulations are conducted using ANSYS Fluent 2023 R2. Results reveal that different cavity geometries lead to variations in peak pressure and amplification factors, with the semicircular cavity demonstrating the highest amplification. This research highlights the significance of cavity geometry in shockwave generation and suggests potential avenues for further investigation, including exploring additional parameters such as cavity dimensions and orientation using advanced computational and machine learning techniques.
